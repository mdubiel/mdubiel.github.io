## Who?

I am **Mateusz** *(pron. /maˈtɛ.uʂ/)*, born in 1982 currently working as an [System Development Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering) in Google.

## Summary
Born in 1982, completed Technical University in 2007
System Engineer with a wide knowledge of technologies.

Fan of heavy metal music and fantasy novels.

For my full history check my LinkedIn profile.

Have a look below for artifacts I prepared about my experience.

- Artifact 1: [Skills and Technologies](../artifacts/skills.md)
- Artifact 2: [Software Development](../artifacts/software-development.md)
- Artifact 3: [System Engineering](../artifacts/system-engineering.md)
- Artifact 4: [Django Developer Journal (Velowerk story)](../artifacts/django-developer-journal.md)

Now, it might not look like it at first glance if you have a read of my CV, but if you ask me to do task A on system B to get result C, you'll most likely get that result relatively quickly and to a good standard, even if I don't know the [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology) or environment. I'm a quick learner, and I like to really get my head around what's going on and how to make things better, delivering the best scalable results.

I pay a lot of attention to the little bits and bobs and how well a solution might [scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability).

I'm particularly keen on [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) based systems, and any sort of [management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_system) where you can control a whole bunch of systems or even environments from one place. Along with that comes [automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation) using all the modern bits and bobs like [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), [Puppet](https://www.puppet.com/) or [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

Throwing a bit of [Python](https://www.python.org/) coding and [Bash scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) into this [SysEng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering) mix makes it work a treat and a lot easier. I reckon 'if it can be scripted, it should be scripted' and I'd rather spend a bit of time automating a solution than repeating myself like a broken record with all that copy-paste madness.

My shell of choice is: [Bash]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))) / [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/), [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux).

*I'll be sharing my [dotfiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_file) repo once I've given it a bit of a tidy up :)*

### System Engineering & Integration

My journey into the world of systems really kicked off during my time as an IT Technician at the very same University ([Politechnika Opolska](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.po.edu.pl/en/)) where I was also studying [Computer Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science). It was a cracking opportunity to earn a bit of extra dosh while getting proper hands-on experience alongside a small team of fellow students who were just as keen on all things tech. This is where I started building my first proper professional networks, both the human kind and the digital sort! We were tasked with keeping the university's systems running smoothly, and that's where my passion for [automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation) really took hold. I remember setting up [PXE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment) booting to automate [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) installations across multiple machines, which felt like proper wizardry at the time. We also started managing systems centrally, initially with our own custom-written scripts (probably a bit rough around the edges looking back!), but later we brought [Puppet](https://www.puppet.com/) on board to bring a bit more structure to our configuration management. It was also during this time that I had my first proper encounter with a HPC (High-Performance Computing) system. I even had the chance to set up the environment for [parallel computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing) and, if you can believe it, compile my first parallel program in [ANSI C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_C) using [MPI (Message Passing Interface)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface) libraries – a real eye-opener!

My next career chapter took me into a truly professional environment when I joined the System Administration team at Lukas S.A. This period was an incredibly intense but rewarding time of learning, experiencing, and generally getting stuck into all sorts of fascinating technologies. There was a real breadth of systems to get to grips with: from various flavours of [Solaris](https://www.oracle.com/solaris/) and [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux) to mission-critical [Oracle Databases](https://www.oracle.com/database/) and application servers like [WebLogic](https://www.oracle.com/middleware/technologies/weblogic/overview.html) (back in its [BEA Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BEA_Systems) days before Oracle acquired them) and [MQ message brokers](https://www.ibm.com/uk-en/products/mq). Beyond these, there were also a multitude of sophisticated internal systems that kept things really interesting. The sheer scale and complexity of the infrastructure, coupled with the opportunities for development and internal projects, allowed me to progress from a very junior role to a seasoned senior professional by the time I eventually moved on from the company.

My career then took a step into an even more structured and organised environment when I joined the European Central Bank (ECB). While my initial foray involved some operational duties, I quickly progressed into a dedicated System Engineering position. My primary focus revolved around the design, build, and ongoing maintenance of [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux)-based systems, with a particular emphasis on [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux) and [Red Hat Satellite](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/satellite). Alongside this, I also had Data Center duties which included the responsibility for managing hardware assets – everything from initial procurement and inventory to decommissioning. Of course, no modern systems engineering setup would be complete without a few trusty sidekicks, so I heavily relied on helpful tools like [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), [Foreman](https://www.theforeman.org/) (which, as some might know, has a rather close relationship with Satellite), and [Puppet](https://www.puppet.com/). A significant part of my role also involved the intricate task of integrating our platform with a number of external systems, such as centralised system logging and [LDAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol) for authentication. And let's not forget the truly *enriching* experiences I had maintaining [Solaris](https://www.oracle.com/solaris/) installations on glorious [SPARC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARC) architecture, alongside dabbling in a few other wonderfully obscure and niche technologies that certainly kept things… interesting.

Then there was that *utterly unforgettable* chapter working for [ESA/ESOC](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/ESOC), an experience I must mention as being truly… *unique*. However, the full details of that particular adventure are a tale I shall reserve for a more personal setting.

My most recent career chapter, spanning over seven years and counting, began with my acquisition by Google. I joined their "running with screwdriver" team (as they affectionately call it), and I absolutely loved my time as a [Data Center Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center), finding it both enjoyable and a fantastic learning experience. My eagerness to expand my horizons led me to the Data Center Design and Capacity Planning team, where I took on a role as a [Technical Program Manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_program_manager). Being part of such an extraordinary player in the tech world has exposed me to a vast array of different technologies and has been an invaluable experience for gaining expertise and striving for excellence. Most recently, I've moved to the [Distributed Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud/) team, where I'm delighted to be back working with my beloved [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) environments, now joined by my new friend, [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). For now, this chapter of my professional journey concludes here, but the story is far from over and will continue to unfold as I embrace future advancements in my career. Stay tuned for more updates!

### Software devleopment

Even back in my university days studying [Computer Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) at [Politechnika Opolska](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.po.edu.pl/en/), I always had a knack for the nitty-gritty. Whether it was wrestling with the low-level intricacies of [Assembler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language) (especially that old [8080](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8080)!), getting to grips with the object-oriented world of [Java](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) and [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), or crafting solid bits of code in [ANSI C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_C), I found it all rather engaging. That was also when I started taking my first steps into the world of [Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence), even building my own [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network) using good old [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html). I even dipped my toes into the world of industrial automation with languages like [SAIA](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.saia-pcd.com/) and similar technologies. I always enjoyed tackling the algorithmic challenges, wrapping my head around things like [O() notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) and generally trying to write efficient and well-structured code.

Moving on from the academic side of things, during my time at university, I also got stuck into a proper real-world project with my colleague, [Tomasz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tkarbownicki/). I was the main developer behind an entire portal for beer enthusiasts called [piweczko.org](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.google.com/search%3Fq%3Dpiweczko.org). This venture actually saw significant traction within the beer-loving community, building a dedicated user base and becoming a go-to resource for many. As the lead developer, I was responsible for delivering the entire [full-stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-stack_developer) product, from architecting the [PHP](https://www.php.net/) backend and designing the [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database schema, right through to implementing the front-end features. This involved writing countless [PostgreSQL SQL scripts](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-commands.html) to power all aspects of the site. It was a challenging experience, especially juggling it with university studies, but it provided invaluable practical experience in all stages of software development, from initial concept to a live, functioning product in the market. I truly believe that tackling such a demanding project was the best possible learning curve for becoming a well-rounded [Software Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineer).

Despite the rewarding experience of building and running a full-stack product like [piweczko.org](https://www.google.com/search%253Fq%253Dpiweczko.org), I deliberately chose to pursue opportunities in [Systems Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering) for the subsequent years. This decision was driven by the exciting prospects that arose at the time, but my passion for coding never truly faded. I continued to enjoy tackling smaller coding tasks for professional purposes, finding it incredibly satisfying to automate repetitive work and build useful tools. My scripting focus shifted towards [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)%23Scripting) and [Perl](https://www.perl.org/), which were particularly handy in the [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) environments I was working in. Later on, I embraced [Python](https://www.python.org/) for its versatility and power, using it to build scripts that streamlined daily tasks and, crucially, to construct complete [CI/CD](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-ci-cd) (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) pipelines. It was during this period that I first encountered [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) and its ecosystem of tools, which became instrumental in automating software delivery. It was also during this diverse period that I had the distinct pleasure of wrestling with the sheer elegance and intuitive nature of technologies like [Lotus Script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LotusScript) and [WLST (WebLogic Scripting Tool)](https://docs.oracle.com/middleware/1221/wlst/WLSTC/intro.htm) – experiences that truly broadened my definition of what constitutes a 'developer-friendly' environment.

More recently, I've found myself back in the delightful world of [Python](https://www.python.org/), and I've thoroughly enjoyed diving deep into the fabulous [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework for building web applications. This return has been a fantastic learning curve, really solidifying my understanding of the [MVC (Model-View-Controller)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) architectural pattern and how all the elements of a professional web application knit together, along with the various challenges that come with it. I've also embraced the evolution of web design, getting to grips with modern technologies like [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and the rather clever [HTMX](https://htmx.org/). I've put these skills to good use by building a number of web applications, some for my own personal projects and others as bespoke solutions for clients. While NDAs prevent me from going into too much detail about the professional ones, I can certainly highlight some of my personal creations (you can find more about these in my artifacts page):

* **Beryl:** A personal collectibles manager for things like books and vinyl records.
* **Jaspis:** A [LEGO](https://www.lego.com/) investment app designed to track assets, monitor prices, and integrate with selling platforms.
* **Amber:** An aspiring framework intended to simplify the creation of mailing list systems and landing pages for newcomers.
* **Velowerk:** A customer portal in development for bike shops, aiming to connect bike owners with local workshops.

Looking ahead, I'm committed to continuous growth, always eager to learn new technologies, and to further advance my skills in the ones I already know and love. The ongoing story of my development journey, including more details on projects like Velowerk, will continue in my Developer Journal.
