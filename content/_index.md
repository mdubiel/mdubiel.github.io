# hi there!

I am **Mateusz** *(pron. /maˈtɛ.uʂ/)* and this is my portfolio and developer journal.

> This portfolio is under construction, new content and modification coming soon.

Here you can read more [about me](about.md).

Explore my portfolio to learn more about my professional journey, skills, and the projects I have worked on.

I especially invite you to follow me on **[Developer Journal](../artifacts/django-developer-journal.md)**, where I share key concepts, programming ideas, and software architecture for building modern web applications.
