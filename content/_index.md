# hi there!

I am **Mateusz** *(pron. /maˈtɛ.uʂ/)*, an accomplished [System Development Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering) with extensive experience in managing both physical infrastructure and cloud environments. I have a proven track record of delivering high-impact [Data Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center) solutions and developing robust [Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) management platforms, including air-gapped environments. I am passionate about [automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation) and process optimization, with strong leadership skills and expertise in [Python programming](https://www.python.org/). As a results-driven professional, I am dedicated to creating efficient, scalable, and secure systems.

Currently, I work as a System Development Engineer in [GDC Air-Gapped solutions](https://cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud/), where my daily responsibilities involve managing [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) systems. I also have extensive experience with data center operations and hardware, complemented by some exposure to [Technical Program Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_program_manager). My role involves building complete Linux Management platforms, handling on-call duties.

Beyond infrastructure and automation, I have a strong interest in full-stack development, particularly using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/). Django’s structured, "batteries-included" approach allows me to build scalable and maintainable applications efficiently, leveraging Python’s simplicity and power. On the frontend, I prefer using [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) for dynamic interactions without complex JavaScript frameworks and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for a streamlined, utility-first approach to styling. I enjoy designing end-to-end solutions, from database models to user interfaces, ensuring clean architecture and smooth functionality. Whether for professional projects or personal initiatives, I apply the same principles of efficiency, security, and reliability to my software development work.

I hold a degree in [Computer Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) and have a strong background in Linux, having worked with [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/) and [Slackware](http://www.slackware.com/) in the past. Additionally, I am passionate about [smart home technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_automation) and work with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).
