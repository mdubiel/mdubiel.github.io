**Last Updated:** 2025-04-25

Welcome to mdubiel.github.io(https://mdubiel.github.io). Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how I collect, use, and protect information in relation to my website.

I may collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit our site. This data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address (often anonymized or truncated), browser type, browser version, the pages of our site that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, and other statistics.

This site uses Google Analytics, which collects information about site traffic and usage patterns. This information is typically non-personally identifying.

We do not collect personally identifying information like your name or email address unless you voluntarily provide it to us (e.g., by contacting us directly).

### 2. Cookies

**What are Cookies?**

Cookies are small files containing a string of characters that are sent to your computer when you visit a website. Cookies allow a site to recognize your browser and store user preferences and other information.

**How We Use Cookies**

*   **Cookie Consent:** I use a cookie via `localStorage` in your browser to remember whether you have accepted our cookie usage banner. This prevents the banner from appearing on subsequent visits once accepted.
*   **Google Analytics:** Google Analytics uses cookies to collect data about website traffic and user interaction. This helps me understand how visitors use my site and improve it. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website will be transmitted to and stored by Google.

**Controlling Cookies**

You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, some portions of our site may not function properly. You can usually find cookie settings in the 'Options' or 'Preferences' menu of your browser.

### 3. Google Analytics

I use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses cookies to help me analyze how users use the site. The information collected is generally anonymous and used for statistical purposes.

Google's ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.

You can prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout

### 4. Data Security

I strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we aim to protect your data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
