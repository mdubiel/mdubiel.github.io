## Who?

I am **Mateusz** *(pron. /maˈtɛ.uʂ/)*, born in 1982 and currently working as a [System Development Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering) at Google.

## Introduction

Born in 1982, I completed my studies at the Technical University in 2007 and have since built a career as a System Engineer with a broad understanding of various technologies.

Outside of work, I'm a fan of heavy metal music and fantasy novels.

## What I Bring to the Table

Now, while my [CV](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mdubiel/) might not immediately reveal this, if you need task A done on system B to achieve result C, you can likely expect a relatively quick and high-quality outcome. This holds true even if I'm not initially familiar with the specific [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology) or environment. I pride myself on being a fast learner with a drive to deeply understand how things work and how to improve them, always aiming to deliver the best scalable results.

I pay close attention to detail and the potential for a solution to [scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability).

I have a particular fondness for [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) based systems and any [management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_system) that allows for centralised control over multiple systems or even entire environments. Naturally, this goes hand-in-hand with [automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation) using modern tools like [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), [Puppet](https://www.puppet.com/), and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

Integrating [Python](https://www.python.org/) coding and [Bash scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) into this [SysEng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering) mix makes everything run more smoothly and efficiently. My philosophy is that 'if it can be scripted, it should be scripted,' and I prefer to invest time in automating solutions rather than repeatedly resorting to the tedium of copy-pasting.

My preferred shells and tools are: [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) / [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/), [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), and [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux).

*I'll be sharing my [dotfiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_file) repository once I've had a chance to tidy them up.*
